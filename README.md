## Abstract

This paper presents a completed formulation of string theory by introducing harmonic standing wave dynamics, toroidal resonance structures, and a recursive dimensional framework. This approach resolves inconsistencies in conventional string theory by embedding all known string models within a unified harmonic field.

The theory reinterprets extra dimensions as frequency bands, introduces the observer as a resonance calibrator, and models physical constants as emergent from geometric phase-locked standing waves. The result is a unified model integrating quantum gravity, field topology, and conscious agency.
